# Darcs Status Tracker

This project is designed to provide a simple view into the status of
various "branches" (check-outs) in darcs repositories, and provide an
easy view of which patches exist where.

The idea is to provide a sort of "dashboard view" into the status of
mulitple trees, quite possibly representing multiple developers and/or
multiple server environments, etc.
